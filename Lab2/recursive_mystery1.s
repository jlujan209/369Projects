# tomato added space to the stack, saving index values fron 8 to 0, and return addresses inbetween them. It recursively called upon orange, which would perform the sum tracking logic, storing the running sum of each element in list1 (up to index 8 as specified by the value 9 being stored into $a0) into $v0. As orange accessed the stack, it would then decrease the space on the stack, removing the previously stored index values and return addresses.
